# About Me

My name is Mike

I am an aspiring data analyst enrolled in the Merit America Data Analytics bootcamp working on completing my Google Data Analytics Certificate. With this program I am very much looking forward to learning R and SQL as well as improve upon my skills in Excel, Python, and Tableau. I am also a Non-Inventory Receiver for Amazon, where I also utilize Excel and data analytics to monitor our various metrics and act on any anomalies to that data. 
I graduated in California State University, San Bernardino in 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration, Marketing concentration. I worked for a brief period of time in social media marketing. In marketing,  I utilized SPSS to tabulate data gathered through marketing research and performed various analysis on this data to gain customer insight. I was also fortunate enough to get experience in analyzing social media data and leveraging that to improve upon our social media strategy as well as positioning. 
My whole professional career up to this point has been very data- driven. I want to move beyond just using data but also manipulating it and analyzing it to tell a story. Through my past experiences as well as what I will learn by the completion of my program with Merit America, I look forward to jump more into the world of data. I hope to be able to use data to help companies see the big picture and also share my enthusiasm about how useful data is in all of our lives.
